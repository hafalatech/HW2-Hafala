From the results of the monitor, we can see that when a process becomes SHORT, 
its priority is higher then OTHER, we can see this when we monitor a switch from OTHER to SHORT, the reason is 
“A task with higher priority returns from waiting”, After that, the SHORT process is running until it ends or until it becomes OVERDUE,
Therefor, if it finishes its task while still remaining ‘NOT  OVERDUE’, we see the reason for the switch as “A task ended”, as expected from the assignment requirements.
Otherwise, if the process becomes OVERDUE we can see that it frees the CPU, with reason 
“A task with higher priority returns from waiting” and only returns with the reason “A previous task goes out for waiting”, as expected.

Also, between SHORT to SHORT switch, we can see that the reason is “A task yields the CPU”
